# Initx
_[A **`TheoryLabs`** project] - | `initx` | `@theorylabs/initx` | `v0.0.1` |_ 

> _`git init`. `yarn init`. `npm init`. `initty mc-nit-nit init`. Starting a new project doesn't have to **suck**. As devs, we've got a **million and one** tooling tools to tool with 
   that make building **awesome shit** easy. Almost feels like cheating, **almost**. Yet, the first steps to the journey seem to always only ever remain the same. Initx is your cli 
   app for starting projects, **now**. Stop building apps like you did when MySpace was a thing. Its 2021. Cheers to the future._
